### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew.

I teach people with diverse backgrounds and diverse skill sets how to build full stack web apps at [Prime Digital Academy](https://www.primeacademy.io/).

I like talking about tech so much, I joined a club for talking.  They even made me president.  If you're free Thursdays at Noon Central, [join us](https://1767.toastmastersclubs.org/)!

I live in San Francisco.

With my amazing wife and our adorable cat Simone.

In my free time, I like to [tell stories](https://dnd.wizards.com/adventurers-league) with friends and strangers.

I like building things to help people:
- [Nicu Calc](https://www.nicucalc.org/)

I also like building things for fun:
- [Auth Is Cool](https://authis.cool/)

Sometimes I build things, just because I wonder if I can:

  I'm not letting you control my lights!  This is a real project, but it requires a login.  If you're interested, check out the code in my pinned repos.
